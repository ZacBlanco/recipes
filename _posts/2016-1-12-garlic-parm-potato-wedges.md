Here's how to make delicious garlic parmesean potato wedges. First, get all the ingredients you need:

- 3 large russet potatoes, cut into wedges
- 4 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1/2 cup parmesean cheese
- salt to taste
- 2 tsp of Italian seasoning
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp paprika

Once you have everything together, here's what you do with it:

1. Put the potato wedges into a large bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over the potatoes and toss to coat. Add the parmesean and toss again.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika. Sprinkle seasoning onto the potatoes and toss one more time.
3. Place the wedges **skin side down** onto a foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 40 minutes at 400F / 200C, until potatoes are fork-tender and golden.
